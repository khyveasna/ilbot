This is an IRC logging bot, and a web interface for showing the logs.

# Project Status

Due to legal uncertainties, I have shut down the main instance
that I was developing this software for.

Therefore, I have no more reason to maintain it. Please consider
it abandonware, and at the same time, feel free to fork this
project (in compliances with its license, see file `LICENSE`).

When you run an IRC logger, please consider the privacy implications.

# Installation and Backends 

For installation please run ./install

When upgrading from older versions of ilbot, please read UPGRADE.pod.

Backends:
    The ./install script only support mysql as database backend,
    but the rest of the code also supports PostgreSQL. There is no working
    migration between mysql and postgresql ilbot databases.
